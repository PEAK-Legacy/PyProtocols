Items needing investigation or implementation for PyProtocols 1.0

 * Check if anybody's using the 'factory' argument to 'adapt()', and if not, 
   get rid of it.

 * If 'factory' isn't used anywhere, consider ditching the second parameter 
   passed to adapters.  That is, instead of calling 'someadapter(ob,proto)', 
   just call 'someadapter(ob)'.  This would give PyProtocols adapters the same 
   calling signature as e.g. Zope adapters.

 * Release 0.9.3, after testing against the latest Zope X3 and updating docs 
   to reflect what version of Zope X3 is supported/tested.

 * Produce an updated version of PEP 246

 * Add a "single-dispatch generic function" demo/example

 * Consider changing "adapter algebra" to allow OR-ing adapters as well as 
   chaining them, using some sort of implicative partial ordering.  This would 
   allow (for example) substituting one adapter for another, by specifying 
   that one adapter "is better than" another, but *without* using depth 
   numbers.  Instead, an implication graph would be kept, and 
   ambiguously-ordered adapters would be disallowed.  This needs some API 
   design work, though.

 * Add a 'protocols.tupleOf(*protocols)' type, for matching tuples of a 
   given size and set of protocols.  E.g. 'protocols.tupleOf(int,str)' would 
   match tuples whose first element is an 'int' and second element is a 
   'str'.  (Note that this type is of very limited use without the ability to 
   "OR" adapters, since multiple adaptations from the 'tuple' type are 
   ambiguous in PyProtocols' current scheme.)
