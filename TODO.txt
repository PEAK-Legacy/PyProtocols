Items needing investigation or implementation for PyProtocols 1.0

 * Fully drop the 'factory' argument to 'adapt', and upgrade the two-argument
   adapter warning to a DeprecationWarning (for complete removal in 1.1).

 * Add a "single-dispatch generic function" demo/example

 * Produce an updated version of PEP 246

 * Consider changing "adapter algebra" to allow OR-ing adapters as well as
   chaining them, using some sort of implicative partial ordering.  This would
   allow (for example) substituting one adapter for another, by specifying
   that one adapter "is better than" another, but *without* using depth
   numbers.  Instead, an implication graph would be kept, and
   ambiguously-ordered adapters would be disallowed.  This needs some API
   design work, though.

 * Add a 'protocols.tupleOf(*protocols)' type, for matching tuples of a
   given size and set of protocols.  E.g. 'protocols.tupleOf(int,str)' would
   match tuples whose first element is an 'int' and second element is a
   'str'.  (Note that this type is of very limited use without the ability to
   "OR" adapters, since multiple adaptations from the 'tuple' type are
   ambiguous in PyProtocols' current scheme.)
