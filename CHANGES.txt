Fixes and Enhancements since PyProtocols 0.9

 - Added the 'factoryMethod' and 'equivalentProtocols' keywords to 'advise()'.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'sequenceOf()', allowing you to easily create a protocol
   that represents a sequence of some base protocol, and automatically adapt
   basic sequences (e.g. lists and tuples) to a "sequence of" the base
   protocol, as long as all members of the input sequence can be adapted to the
   base protocol.  By default, only lists and tuples are considered to support
   'IBasicSequence'.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'protocolForType()' and 'protocolForURI()', that allow you
   to link interfaces by intended semantics, not just by having identical
   instances.  For example, you can use 'protocolForType(file,["read"])' to
   symbolize a file-like object with a 'read()' method, or
   'protocolForURI("some UUID")' to symbolize some documented interface.

   In addition to compact declarations, this also allows a module to refer to
   an interface without importing a specific definition of it.  Then, when that
   module is used in a larger program, the linkage between the symbolic and
   actual forms of the interface can be accomplished semi-automatically.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Enhanced Zope 3 support: Now, adapters can be registered between
   Zope interfaces, and any types or instances.  Note, however, that
   interface-to-interface adaptation may not work if a class only declares what
   it implements using the Zope interface API.  This limitation might be able
   to be removed later.  Zope interfaces can now pass a much larger segment of
   the test suite than before.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'protocols.Variation(baseProtocol,context=None)'; this
   implements the 'LocalProtocol' example in the documentation.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'Adapter' and 'StickyAdapter' convenience base classes.
   'Adapter' offers a ready-made '__init__()' method suitable for most adapter
   classes, while 'StickyAdapter' instances automatically declare themselves as
   an instance-specific adapter for any object they're used on.  Thus, a
   'StickyAdapter' can maintain its state across 'adapt()' calls for the same
   object, so long as the object can have instance-specific adapters declared.
   (See "Protocol Declarations for Individual Objects" in the reference manual
   for more information on this.)

 - Added experimental support for 'ExtensionClass'; previously, PyProtocols
   could raise bizarre errors and/or behave strangely when 'adapt()' was called
   on 'ExtensionClass' instances.

 - Fixed a memory leak in the C "speedups" module that leaked unbound
   '__conform__' and '__adapt__' methods, as well as '__class__' and '__mro__'
   references.  Also, fixed the C code potentially reraising invalid error
   tracebacks under certain circumstances.
