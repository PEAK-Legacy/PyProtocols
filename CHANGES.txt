Fixes and Enhancements since PyProtocols 0.9

 - Added the 'factoryMethod' and 'equivalentProtocols' keywords to 'advise()'.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'protocolForType()' and 'protocolForURI()', that allow you
   to link interfaces by intended semantics, not just by having identical
   instances.  For example, you can use 'protocolForType(file,["read"])' to
   symbolize a file-like object with a 'read()' method, or
   'protocolForURI("some UUID")' to symbolize some documented interface.

   In addition to compact declarations, this also allows a module to refer to
   an interface without importing a specific definition of it.  Then, when that
   module is used in a larger program, the linkage between the symbolic and
   actual forms of the interface can be accomplished semi-automatically.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Enhanced Zope 3 support: Now, adapters can be registered between
   Zope interfaces, and any types or instances.  Note, however, that
   interface-to-interface adaptation may not work if a class only declares what
   it implements using the Zope interface API.  This limitation might be able
   to be removed later.  Zope interfaces can now pass a much larger segment of
   the test suite than before.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'protocols.Variation(baseProtocol,context=None)'; this
   implements the 'LocalProtocol' example in the documentation.

 - (NEEDS DOC) Added 'Adapter' and 'StickyAdapter' convenience base classes.
   'Adapter' offers a ready-made '__init__()' method suitable for most adapter
   classes, while 'StickyAdapter' instances automatically declare themselves as
   an instance-specific adapter for any object they're used on.  Thus, a
   'StickyAdapter' can maintain its state across 'adapt()' calls for the same
   object, so long as the object can have instance-specific adapters declared.
   (See "Protocol Declarations for Individual Objects" in the reference manual
   for more information on this.)

 - Added experimental support for 'ExtensionClass'; previously, PyProtocols
   could raise bizarre errors and/or behave strangely when 'adapt()' was called
   on 'ExtensionClass' instances.

 - Fixed a memory leak in the C "speedups" module that leaked unbound
   '__conform__' and '__adapt__' methods, as well as '__class__' and '__mro__'
   references.  Also, fixed the C code potentially reraising invalid error
   tracebacks under certain circumstances.
